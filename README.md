# Pseudoprimes
Lists of pseudoprimes above 2^64

# Background
Craig Loizides tested all prime gaps from 2^64 to 19618891966498830390 using only a single Fermat test to base 2, after sieving with primes up to 39000.
This means that he may have missed a small subset of numbers - namely, ones that are weak Fermat pseudoprimes to base 2, and have no prime factors below 39000.

Currently, the files in the "lists" directory collectively list every base-2 pseudoprime from 2^64 to 1.9619e19 that have no prime factors below 39000.

With these two pieces put together, we have now verified that the 83rd maximal gap is greater than 19618891966498830390.
